# SimplestGodRay3D
![Preview](addons/simplest_god_ray_3d/screenshots/screenshot_0.png)

**SimplestGodRay3D** is a custom Node3D for Godot 4 that creates efficient, stylized light shafts (aka god rays) using a single QuadMesh and a shader. It provides an artistic alternative to volumetric fog with much better performance and visual control.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Stylized 3D light shaft using `QuadMesh` + `ShaderMaterial`
- Simulates a trapezoidal volumetric beam using vertex distortion
- Full editor exposure: control width, height, spread, intensity, transparency, fade distance, and color
- Visibility layer support (cull mask compatibility)
- Lightweight and GPU-friendly
- Editor-visible with `@tool` support

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- **Godot 4.4+**
- Forward+ rendering mode

---

## üß™ How to Use

1. Download the simplest_god_ray_3d folder from the Godot assetLib or from gitHub
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è**ONLY IF DOWNLOADED FROM GITHUB** In the addons folder of your project(if you don't have one, create it), paste the simplest_god_ray_3d folder
1. Enable the addon from `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`
2. Add a new `SimplestGodRay3D` node to your scene
3. Adjust the exposed parameters in the Inspector:
   - `width`, `height`: size of the beam
   - `spread`: controls the trapezoidal shape
   - `intensity`, `transparency`: affects color and opacity
   - `fade_distance`: controls fade-out over distance
   - `use_occlusion`: enables or disables automatic cut-off with scene geometry using the depth buffer
   - `visibility_layers`: limit visibility to selected cameras

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- No dynamic shadows.
- Transparent overlap artifacts may occur when multiple beams cross or when mixed with other alpha-based geometry (like Sprite3D).
- Not physically accurate ‚Äî this is a stylized, artistic effect, so it does not interact with the geometry of the scene.

## üî≠ What's Next

Planned improvements for future versions of **SimplestGodRay3D**:

- **‚ú® Dust Particles**
  - Add optional projected dust motes inside the god ray.

- **üå´Ô∏è Embedded Fog Layer**
  - Add support for internal fog/brume projection inside the god ray to simulate light scattering in humid or dense air.
